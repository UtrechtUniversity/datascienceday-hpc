# Data Science Day 2018 Workshop - HPC: Speed up your data science problems!

*Authors: [Roel Brouwer](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/RJJBrouwer) and [Kees van Eijden](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/CJvanEijden/0) and [Jonathan de Bruin](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/JdeBruin1)*

Is your desktop occupied for a couple of days because of a long-running data
science problem? Or doesn’t your program even start because your computer does
not have enough memory? It’s time to run your problem on a computer cluster! A
computer cluster consists of many interconnected computers. The trick to speed
up your computations is to use these computers in parallel.

In this hands-on Breakout Session, we show you how to split up a data science
problem and run it on several computers at the same time. You will learn how
to access the cluster, upload files and schedule programs. We will provide you
with an account to a cluster. You will be working on your laptop. We strongly
advise Windows users to install MobaXterm and Mac users to install Cyberduck
in advance.
